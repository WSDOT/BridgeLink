# BridgeLink

BridgeLink is a bridge engineering application framework. BridgeLink provides a single entry point into a suite of bridge engineering applications such as [BEToolbox](https://github.com/WSDOT/BEToolbox), [PGSuper](https://github.com/WSDOT/PGSuper), and [XBeamRate](https://github.com/WSDOT/XBeamRate). BridgeLink applications are runtime discovered and automatically integrated in the application framework.

## Getting Started
