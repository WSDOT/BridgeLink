Modeling consists of both defining the roadway alignment and the bridge framing. The roadway alignment model includes horizontal curves with entry and exit spirals, symmetrical and unsymmetrical vertical curves, and superelevation transitions. Bridge modeling includes skewed piers, single and multi-span structures, non-parallel (splayed) girders, different number and type of girders in each span, and varying width bridge decks. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00046"></a><span class="lineno">   46</span>&#160;Girder Types | PGSuper supports eleven parametric girder types including I-Beams, Bulb Tees, U-Beams, Voided Slabs, and Box Beams. Additional girder types can be included through third party extensions.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00047"></a><span class="lineno">   47</span>&#160;Stress Analysis | Stress analysis can be performed using gross or transformed section properties.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00048"></a><span class="lineno">   48</span>&#160;Prestress Losses | Prestress losses can be computed using the AASHTO LRFD simplified method, TxDOT simplified method, AASHTO LRFD refined method, or a general lump sum method. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00049"></a><span class="lineno">   49</span>&#160;Design | Use the design tool to quickly design your precast girders.

Up to three different design strategies can be used to optimize designs for your local fabricators.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00050"></a><span class="lineno">   50</span>&#160;Load Rating | Load and Resistance Factor Ratings (LRFR) are performed in accordance with the Section 6A for the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation. Level 1, 2, and 3 load ratings are performed. Load posting analysis is automatically performed as needed.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00051"></a><span class="lineno">   51</span>&#160;Lifting and Hauling Analysis | Girders can be analyzed and designed for stresses and stability during lifting and hauling.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00052"></a><span class="lineno">   52</span>&#160;User Interface | PGSuper offers a rich, bridge-centric, user interface that keeps your attention on designing bridges. Information is presented in customary engineering drawing formats include plan, section, and elevation views. Interact directly with a graphical representation of your bridge and its components instead of wading through obscure menu commands and hierarchical data structures.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00053"></a><span class="lineno">   53</span>&#160;Analysis Results | Analysis results are presented in graphical and textual format. Quickly understand the behavior of your bridge by reviewing moment, shear, and deflection diagrams. Limit state demands are plotted with allowable stresses and section resistance for easy verification of LRFD code requirements. Reports can contain as little or as much information as you like. Sometimes a summary of controlling stress is all you need. Other times, you want to really dig in and understand how the software computed a particular value. Engineering  software should never be a black box. The details of every calculation is available through reports.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00054"></a><span class="lineno">   54</span>&#160;Customization | PGSuper is unique in that it doesn&#39;t have any default values. New projects are created from templates and the templates establish default values. PGSuper also has a library system where frequently used sets of complex information are stored. The library system includes definitions of common materials, girders, barriers, vehicles, project criteria, and load rating criteria. Together, the templates and libraries form a PGSuper Configuration.  You can create your own PGSuper Configuration and tailor it to your specific needs. PGSuper can be customized by changing its configuration.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00055"></a><span class="lineno">   55</span>&#160;Extensions | PGSuper can be extended with PGSuper Application Extensions. WSDOT and TxDOT have created extensions that provide agency-specific features. The WSDOT Girder Schedule report is one example. This report brings together all of the information a designer needs to include in the girder schedule for a WSDOT PS&amp;E package.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00056"></a><span class="lineno">   56</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00057"></a><span class="lineno">   57</span>&#160;## [PGSplice](../../PGSplice/3.0/)</div><div class="line"><a name="l00058"></a><span class="lineno">   58</span>&#160;PGSplice is a BridgeLink Application for design, analysis, and load rating of spliced precast-prestressed girder bridges in accordance with AASHTO Specifications. PGSplice can model a wide variety of spliced girder bridge configurations including multi-span structures with cantilever pier segments, drop in field segments, erection towers, strong back hangers and multi-stage post-tensioning.
