Using unlicensed software is, for all intents and purposes, a copyright violation and subjects you to monetary fines and federal prosecution. With open source software, you have the right to use the software any time you want, on as many computers as you want, for any purpose you want. You just have to install it and use it. There is no need for a complex license management solution.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00040"></a><span class="lineno">   40</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00041"></a><span class="lineno">   41</span>&#160;### Distribution</div><div class="line"><a name="l00042"></a><span class="lineno">   42</span>&#160;You are going to love BridgeLink and all of its applications. You will be telling your friends and colleagues all about it and they are going to want a copy. Unlike proprietary software, you can give a copy to anyone; for gratis or for a fee. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00043"></a><span class="lineno">   43</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00044"></a><span class="lineno">   44</span>&#160;### Validation</div><div class="line"><a name="l00045"></a><span class="lineno">   45</span>&#160;As an engineer, you are responsible for your designs. When you choose to use computer software to perform calculations on your behalf, you are still responsible for your design. So how do you know the software is performing correctly for your particular situation? Hopefully the software provides enough detail in the output that the calculations can be verified. With open source software, you get the source code so you can look at how every calculation is performed. You can run the software in a debugger with your input data and watch how every calculation is performed. Only open source software gives you this unprecedented ability to validate the procedures and results of the engineering computations on which you are relying for the accuracy of your work and ultimately public safety.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00046"></a><span class="lineno">   46</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00047"></a><span class="lineno">   47</span>&#160;### Choice</div><div class="line"><a name="l00048"></a><span class="lineno">   48</span>&#160;With other types of software you are typically locked into a single source for support, service, and enhancements. With open source software, you are free to get support, service, and enhancements from anyone willing to provide them. Don&#39;t like the telephone support you are getting? No problem, purchase it from someone else. Want a feature added to the software? No problem, do it yourself or contract with someone to do it for you. Open Source Software gives you an incredible amount of freedom and choice.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00049"></a><span class="lineno">   49</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00050"></a><span class="lineno">   50</span>&#160;### Why Open Source?</div><div class="line"><a name="l00051"></a><span class="lineno">   51</span>&#160;WSDOT is developing its BridgeLink suite of applications as open source software because it creates benefits for WSDOT that far exceeds that which would be realized if a more restrictive model was used. WSDOT creates its own bridge engineer software tools when suitable commercial alternatives are not available or when a software tool is critical to procedures and processes and the inability to control that software adversely impacts WSDOT.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00052"></a><span class="lineno">   52</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00053"></a><span class="lineno">   53</span>&#160;The value of software to WSDOT is the value that is derived from using it as a tool. WSDOT can do things more efficiently and effectively with the tool than without it. Since the software does not have value as a saleable commodity there is no harm or loss by making it available to everyone for gratis.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00054"></a><span class="lineno">   54</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00055"></a><span class="lineno">   55</span>&#160;Tax dollars pay the salaries and purchase the resources needed to develop this software. The open source software model allows WSDOT to maximize the return on those dollars. WSDOT has realized many benefits using an open source model including:</div><div class="line"><a name="l00056"></a><span class="lineno">   56</span>&#160;* Minimal number of defects as a result of broad and diverse usage of our software tools</div><div class="line"><a name="l00057"></a><span class="lineno">   57</span>&#160;* Increased robustness of feature sets as a result of external inputs</div><div class="line"><a name="l00058"></a><span class="lineno">   58</span>&#160;* Reduced development cost through collaborative development efforts</div><div class="line"><a name="l00059"></a><span class="lineno">   59</span>&#160;* Ensured longevity of the software as non-WSDOT users develop vested interests in the long term viability of the software</div><div class="line"><a name="l00060"></a><span class="lineno">   60</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00061"></a><span class="lineno">   61</span>&#160;The open source software model is an excellent fit for government developed software.
