<p class=H2><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: normal;">With 
 this License, the Bridge and Structures Office of the Washington State 
 Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is supporting open source software 
 concepts, while including appropriate warranty and liability provisions 
 designed to protect itself from any claims relating to software program 
 output. The following excerpt from the GNU General Public License is consistent 
 with WSDOT's commitment to open source software.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The licenses 
 for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and 
 change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
 guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure 
 the software is free for all its users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; 
 </span>This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
 using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
 the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your 
 programs, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-top: 0in;
			margin-right: .5in;
			margin-left: .5in;
			margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">When 
 we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
 General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
 to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if 
 you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, 
 that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; 
 and that you know you can do these things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-top: 0in;
			margin-right: .5in;
			margin-left: .5in;
			margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">To 
 protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
 deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
 translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies 
 of the software, or if you modify it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-top: 0in;
			margin-right: .5in;
			margin-left: .5in;
			margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">For 
 example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
 for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. 
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-top: 0in;
			margin-right: .5in;
			margin-left: .5in;
			margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">We 
 protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
 and/or modify the software.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-top: 0in;
			margin-right: .5in;
			margin-left: .5in;
			margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Also, 
 for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone 
 understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software 
 is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know 
 that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
 by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-top: 0in;
			margin-right: .5in;
			margin-left: .5in;
			margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Finally, 
 any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish 
 to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually 
 obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent 
 this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's 
 free use or not licensed at all.</span></p>

<p class=H2><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: normal;">While 
 WSDOT has based this License upon the GNU General Public License, this 
 License is not a GNU license.</span></p>

<p class=H2><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; text-transform: uppercase;">Terms 
 and Conditions of the Alternate Route Open Source License</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">1. 
 </span></b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">All terms and conditions of 
 this License apply to any program or other work which contains a notice 
 placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the 
 terms of the Alternate Route Open Source License. The &quot;Program&quot;, 
 below, refers to any such program or work. A &quot;work based on the Program&quot; 
 means a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim 
 or with modifications to either its code, or to its non-code elements 
 (such as specifications or formulas), and/or translated into another language. 
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) 
 A “work based on the Program” may be the Program, Program output (independent 
 of having been made by running the Program), or any derivative work under 
 copyright law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Each licensee 
 is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">2. 
 </span></b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Activities other than copying, 
 distribution and modification are not restricted by this License. The 
 act of running the Program is not restricted, unless the output from the 
 Program includes work based on the Program (independent of having been 
 made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the 
 Program does. The output made by running the program (i.e., bridge design 
 or specifications) is also subject to <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">warranty, 
 disclaimer, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, and indemnification clauses</span>, as 
 specified below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">3.</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided 
 that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each <strong><span 
 style="font-weight: normal;">copy an appropriate copyright notice, and 
 the warranty, disclaimer, assumption of risk and indemnification clauses 
 from this License</span></strong>; keep intact all notices that refer 
 to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and provide any other 
 recipients of the Program with a copy of this License so that they may 
 decide whether to use the Program according to the License terms. You 
 may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you 
 may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">4</span></strong><strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: normal;">.</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> You may modify your copy or copies of the 
 Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, 
 and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
 Section 3 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span></p>

 </span></span><![endif]><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">a)</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> You must cause the modified files to carry 
 prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
 change.</span></p>

 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> You may not use the name of the Program to 
 refer to or identify the modified Program or work based on the Program. 
 Instead, you must appropriately identify a new name that allows others 
 to easily distinguish any modified version from the original version.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;

 </span></span><![endif]><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">c)</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> Any work that you distribute or publish, that 
 in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part 
 thereof, must be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties 
 under the terms of this License. The manner of distribution must designed 
 to provide the potential user with a reasonable opportunity to review 
 the terms of this License prior to use or modification of the Library 
 in accordance with the License terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;

 </span></span><![endif]><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">d)</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> If the modified program normally reads commands 
 interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to display an announcement including 
 the copyright notice and notice of warranty, disclaimer, assumption of 
 risk and indemnification from this License, that users may use and redistribute 
 the program under the License conditions, and telling the user how to 
 view a copy of this License. The display should include a feature that 
 requires the potential user to acknowledge the contents of the display 
 through a mouse-click (or other key stroke) before continuing through 
 the interactive program. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may choose 
 to provide your own warranty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">These requirements 
 apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that 
 work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
 independent and </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">separate works in themselves, 
 then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when 
 you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same 
 sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the 
 distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
 permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
 each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Thus, it is not the 
 intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work 
 written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to 
 control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the 
 Program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">In addition, mere aggregation 
 of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work 
 based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium 
 does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">5.</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> You may copy and distribute the Program (or 
 a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
 under the terms of Sections 4 and 5 above provided that you also do one 
 of the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;
			text-indent: -.25in;
			mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><![if !supportLists]><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;

 </span></span><![endif]><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">a)</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> Accompany it with the complete corresponding 
 machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms 
 of Sections 4 and 5 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; 
 or,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal

 </span></span><![endif]><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">b)</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for 
 at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than 
 your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable 
 copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms 
 of Sections 4 and 5 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; 
 or,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal

 </span></span><![endif]><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">c)</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> Accompany it with the information you received 
 as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative 
 is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received 
 the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord 
 with Subsection b above.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The source code for 
 a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to 
 it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source 
 code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
 files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of 
 the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed 
 need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source 
 or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
 of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
 itself accompanies the executable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">If distribution of 
 executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a<b> 
 </b>designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
 code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even 
 though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
 object code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">6.</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute 
 the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, 
 and will automatically terminate your rights under this License, while 
 leaving the rights of the Licensor and all other Licensees intact. However, 
 parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License 
 will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain 
 in full compliance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">7</span></b><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;">. For software which is copyrighted by WSDOT, 
 WSDOT retains all rights not expressly granted. Nothing in this license 
 agreement constitutes a waiver of WSDOT’s rights under United States copyright 
 laws or any other Federal or State law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">8. 
 </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>If 
 you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
 whose distribution conditions are different, contact the author and ask 
 for permission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">9.</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> You are not required to accept this License, 
 since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
 to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions 
 are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
 you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions 
 for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">10.</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> Each time you redistribute the Program (or 
 any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a 
 license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program 
 subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this 
 License.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">11.</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
 allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
 to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
 agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
 they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot 
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
 may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license 
 would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those 
 who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way 
 you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely 
 from distribution of the Program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">If any portion of this 
 section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, 
 the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole 
 is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">It is not the purpose 
 of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property 
 right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has 
 the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution 
 system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
 have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; 
 it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
 software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">This section is intended 
 to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest 
 of this License.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">12.</span></strong><span 
 style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> If the distribution and/or use of the Program 
 is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
 interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under 
 this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
 excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
 among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates 
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</span></p>

<p class=H2><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">How to Apply These Terms to 
 Your New Programs</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be 
 of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this 
 is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change 
 under these terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. 
 It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
 “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;">&lt;one line to give the program’s name 
 and a brief idea to what it does.&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;">Copyright © yyyy &lt;name of author&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;">This program is free software; you can redistribute 
 it and/or modify it under the terms of the Alternate Route Open Source 
 License as published by the Washington State Department of Transportation,

 that it will be useful, but distribution is AS IS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;

 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the Alternate Route Open Source License for more 
 details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal
	style="margin-left: .5in;">You should have received a copy of the Alternate 
 Route Open Source License along with this program; if not, write to the 
 Washington State Department of Transportation, Bridge and Structures Office,

 WA 98503, USA or e-mail Bridge_Support@wsdot.wa.gov</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the program is interactive, and it uses a splash 
 screen, make it display notice like this on the splash screen:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Open Source License does not permit incorporating 
 your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine 
 or class library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary 
 applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the 
 Alternate Route Library Open Source License instead of this License.</p>
