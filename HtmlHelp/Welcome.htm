<h1>Welcome to BridgeLink<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><symbol 
 name=Trademark><!--begin!kadov{{-->&#8482;<!--}}end!kadov--></span></h1>

<p>BridgeLink is an integrated environment that links together various 
 bridge engineering software tools.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BridgeLink is developed by the Washington State Department of Transportation 
 and is a member of the Alternate Route Project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BridgeLink is licensed under the terms and conditions of the <a HREF="Alternate_Route_Open_Source_License.htm">Alternate 
 Route Open Source License</a>. Please read this license carefully before 
 using this software.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>By itself, BridgeLink does little more than manage the bridge engineering 
 software components that link into the BridgeLink environment. This document 
 describes how to manage these software components. Refer to the documentation 
 for each component to learn more about that component.</p>

<h2>A Bit of History</h2>

<p>For many years, WSDOT published PGSuper as a stand alone application. 
 What was not obvious about this is that PGSuper, as is was known before 
 BridgeLink was release, was in fact BridgeLink. At that time PGSuper and 
 TOGA were the only applications to plug into the environment. Now that 
 there are several plug-ins covering a variety of engineering capabilities, 
 it doesn't make sense to refer to them as plug-ins to PGSuper. </p>
