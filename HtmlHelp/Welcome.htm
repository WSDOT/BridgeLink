<h1>Welcome to BridgeLink<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><symbol 
 name=Trademark><!--begin!kadov{{-->&#8482;<!--}}end!kadov--></span></h1>

<p>BridgeLink is an extensible suite of integrated bridge engineering software 
 tools.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BridgeLink is developed by the Washington State Department of Transportation 
 and is a member of the Alternate Route Project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BridgeLink is licensed under the terms and conditions of the <a HREF="Alternate_Route_Open_Source_License.htm">Alternate 
 Route Open Source License</a>. Please read this license carefully before 
 using this software.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>By itself, BridgeLink does little more than manage the bridge engineering 
 software components that make up the BridgeLink suite of tools. This document 
 describes how to manage these software tools. Specific information about 
 each tool can be found in the documentation provided with those tools.</p>

<h2>A Bit of History</h2>

<p>For many years, WSDOT published PGSuper as a stand alone precast-prestressed 
 concrete bridge design application. Unknown to everyone but the development 
 team was that PGSuper was the precursor to BridgeLink. Early on, PGSuper, 
 Library Manager, and TOGA were the only applications to plug into the 
 environment and they were all related to precast-prestressed concrete. 
 Now that there are many plug-ins covering a wide variety of engineering 
 capabilities, it doesn't make sense to refer to them as for a precast-prestressed 
 concrete software. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BridgeLink is a more fitting name. It captures the idea that the software 
 tools in the suite are related to bridge engineering and these tools link 
 together to form an integrated suite of tools.</p>
