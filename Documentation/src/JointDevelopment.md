Joint Development
=================

The BridgeLink application framework along with the PGSuper and PGSplice applications are developed by WSDOT in partnership with Texas (TxDOT) and Kansas (KDOT) Departments of Transportation. This arrangement has been extremely beneficial to all parties involved as well as to the bridge engineering profession at large. Through our joint development efforts these software tools have become more robust and feature-rich then any one of us could have accomplished alone.

The success of this partnership can be attributed directly to the [open source software](@ref opensource) model. The open source model permits all of the partners to work together collaboratively without any risk of being excluded from software development activities in the future.
