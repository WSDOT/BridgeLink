Configure BridgeLink {#configure_bridgelink}
====================
This is the first page in the BridgeLink Configuration wizard. This wizard will guide you through the configuration process for BridgeLink and any of its applications that need to be configured.

Personalize
-----------
This information is used by BridgeLink applications to personalize reports, graphs, and other output. This information is stored in the Registry on your computer and can be stored inside files created by BridgeLink applications. This information is not collected by WSDOT or TxDOT and is not shared with anyone.

Autosave and Recovery
---------------------
When enabled your files will be automatically saved as you work. Additionally, BridgeLink will be registered with the Windows Restart Manager. In the event of abnormal termination of the program (a crash), BridgeLink will attempt to restart and open an autosaved recovery version of your project. The autosave interval establishes the frequency for saving your project and creating recovery files.

Report Viewer
---------------------
Select between the Standard and Advanced report viewer. The standard report viewer has been traditionally used in the BridgeLink suite of applications. The advanced report viewer is new and supports new reporting features such as automated section numbering, equations generated with computation values, and SVG graphics. The advanced report view is a developing technology and it may, on occasion, not work as expected. For this reason, you can toggle between the standard report view and the advanced report view.
